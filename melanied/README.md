## Overview
This application is a blog site that allows a user to post and article as well as search through other posted articles by author name or category. Once writing an article, the user can preview their post, this preview will display the body in markdown style and code will be in a special code block.

## Getting Started
A user must download the files onto their computer and run in live-server in order to have a fully operational app.

This application uses the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
